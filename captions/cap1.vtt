00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hey guys, it's Maddie!

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.900
So, I've got a brand new lipstick

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.800
VERY BERRY from my new line. Makeup by Maddie

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.050
Follow the natural shape of your lip

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.700
This color is BRIGHT, people.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
So, it'll give you that extra pop!

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.200
Get the right brush

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.800
Stuff is all over the place

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.100
Let's see... The place that you want...

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.500
Wait...ugh..ah...

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Strangled... and it doesn't look like the old girl went down easy

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.700
The detectives always tell me

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.800
PJ, don't solve the cases. Just examine the body

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.200
PJ, don't touch that. That's sensitive evidence

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.400
PJ, did you eat my lasagna?

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.350
YES, Bernard. YES!

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900
I LOVE LASAGNA

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.900
And I just can't help but wonder what happens to some of these poor folks

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.900
HEY, look at that

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
That is definitely a stamp from the Lila Lounge

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.000
I have lost A LOT of my diginity there

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.600
Tess, I'm dying over that lip color

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.900
Oh thanks, Mads, I actually designed it myself

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.800
VERY BERRY

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
You have your own line?

26
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.800
I am making a million selling these

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.800
I actually hurt my wrist counting all that money

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.300
What?

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm kidding, I hurt it at the gym

30
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.300
Um, may I?

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Sure

32
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.500
Could we get two whiskies?

33
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.900
Sure

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.100
Oh no no no no

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.800
No, I'm, I'm getting this one

36
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Thank you

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.800
I'll be right there

38
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.900
I love that lip color on you

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.600
Oh, thanks!

40
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.900
The martinis

41
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900
They'll catch you and then the music

42
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.200
Garbage

43
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.100
Not for me, what are you going to do?

44
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.000
Let's take a look shall we?

45
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.900
Hmm, nice color

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.900
Hey, Maddie, don't forget the rent tonight

47
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.300
Oh crap

48
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.900
This is the fourth month in a row

49
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.200
I, I can't keep covering for you

50
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.200
Do you know I skipped class four times to pick up extra hours at work?

51
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.800
Do you want some free product? You could use it

52
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.300
You know, you used to be nice

53
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000
It was a joke, Morgan, I'm sorry

54
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.000
Okay, bruising...

55
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.300
Strangulation...

56
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.700
The assailant must have used some sort of strap

56
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Hmmm, maybe a jealous lover perhaps

58
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.900
That's a French accent
